# C2DWH | Personal project

Crawling to Data warehousing (C2DWH) project involves crawling an e-commerce site and developing a simple OLAP system to analyze purchasing trends for tech devices such as smartphones, laptops, etc. The ELT pipeline will operate weekly or monthly to spot the changes in pricing, ratings, and number of reviews. These data can help to determine the best-selling products and understand what attracts consumers to these items based on their specifications.
